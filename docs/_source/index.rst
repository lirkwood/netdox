Netdox Overview
===============
Netdox is a highly modular Python 3 application that generates network documentation in PageSeeder markup language (PSML) for display by PageSeeder.
The objective of Netdox is to improve the productivity of network administrators by consolidating information from a range of systems.
This reduces the need for administrators to move between many different interfaces, and minimises the familiarity required with each service.
The documentation is updated and pruned daily to keep data current and accurate, and can be refreshed at any time. 
Moreover, any changes are preserved in comprehensive versions provided by PageSeeder's document history functionality.

Netdox leverages plugins to retrieve data from the services in *your* environment.
This allows you to effectively provide your network administrators with a one-stop shop for querying the state of the network.
This combined with the XRef links between the documents results in a highly connected and transparent visualisation of your network.
