### Other Plugin

# Ansible

This plugin is currently unfinished and does not do anything. In it's current state it relies on the *ssh* plugin to execute it's commands. It does however provide two functions which may be useful for developers looking to write an Ansible plugin.

## Configuring this plugin

The only configuration currently recognised is the *host* key, which defines the domain name of your Ansible instance.
